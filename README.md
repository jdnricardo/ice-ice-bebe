This repository contains a package thinly wrapping some datasets related to your favorite frigid substance. Could eventually include documentation, e.g. a sort of data dictionary for the datasets, and links to any other materials that come out of the project.


Initial project idea -- a dynamic user-interface (or other TBD visualization) displaying a "social network analysis" of all 50 United States Senators.

Each Senator will be represented as a node in this network. Senators can be connected via non-Senator nodes to other Senators and other non-Senators. The types of these connections can be as diverse as a contribution made to a PAC, a meeting with a lobbyist, or the disclosure of a Senator's financial asset.

The goal of such a network analysis will be to correlate financial, lobbying, and/or other influences to legislative actions and outcomes -- a visualization of conflicts of interest, in other words.

Example: Senator W is related to Industry X via Y financial contribution made to PAC Z. Senator W then votes "no" on bill with negative ramifications for Industry X. While no causal connection is possible, it will be possible to infer certain motives that contributed to Senator W's decision.
